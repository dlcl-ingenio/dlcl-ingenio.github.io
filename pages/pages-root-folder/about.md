The purpose of the DLCL INGENIO Creative Student Showcase is to share with the Stanford community the creative works that students are making within their DLCL classes. 

This inaugural INGENIO is titled *Sensing Life, Reimagining Language* since a common theme emerging from submitted works was an exploration of the intersection of art and language. At this intersection, we find ourselves at the heart of what these two modes of expression encompass: the endeavor to make tangible what is the inherently intangible human experience. In comic strips and spoken words and strokes of paint on canvas, students come together from a multitude of languages and cultures to further our understanding of what it is to be human.

The 2022 INGENIO Showcase was organized by:

-  Theresa Nelson, ILAC Major ‘22
- Alyssa Diaz, FRIT Major, ‘22
- Maya Návar, COMPLIT Major, Spanish Minor ‘22.
