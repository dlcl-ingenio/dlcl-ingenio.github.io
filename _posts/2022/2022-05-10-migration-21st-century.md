title:  "Migration in the 21st Century"
teaser: "My work is interdisciplinary and is centered around the discernment of class, labor, and consumption of the brown body. I'm a second-generation immigrant from the working-class landscape of Las Vegas, Nevada. My work's visual language and written text reflect the existential and often hallucinatory existence of immigrants with limited familial histories."
