title:  "Der farbige Junge und der farblose König"
teaser: | 
  This German fairy tale follows the journey of a small boy as he discovers the meaning of color. At first, he lives in a gray world devoid of color. After losing his ball over a massive wall, an angel appears and offers a way into the world of color but warns him that once he starts living life in the world of color, his true colors will show. The boy, not thinking too hardly about the significance of these words, begins helping others in his search for his ball. Eventually, after many acts of service, the boy becomes known as the most colorful boy in the land. This news reaches the king, who wishes to meet this peculiar boy. This meeting allows them both to discover their true colors, which terminates in a death and the coronation of a new ruler.

  I created this fairy tale as a story that could be told for all ages. Through the boy’s exploration of what it means to be both a good person and colorful individual, this story comments on class, service, and morality. I hope you enjoy!
