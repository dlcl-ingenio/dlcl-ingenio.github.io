title:  "Sí se puede"
teaser: "​​My name is Jessica Pacheco, a Mexican American college student who comes from a beautiful culture and a complicated background. I was born in the United States, a place full of opportunities for people seeking the American Dream whereas, in my comic, I portray the challenges immigrants have not only by risking their lives while crossing but also by leaving their families to come to work. This comic can be personal because it represents some of my family's stories but it’s also more universal as this is just the beginning of many other stories. Through this comic, I hope to represent the people I grew up with and illustrate their hard work and sacrifices. I come from the Coachella Valley, which is surrounded by fields of grapes, lemons, onions, etc. As a freshman in college, I had the opportunity in one of my classes to see and be influenced by David Bacon's photography archive, circa 1985-2019 in the Stanford Library of the farmworkers from the Coachella Valley and other regions. For this comic, I have to acknowledge I use some elements and was influenced by some of Bacon’s, my family’s, and the internet’s images to make my comic based on what I thought I could create to represent farm workers."
