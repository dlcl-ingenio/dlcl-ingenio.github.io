title:  "Katia la corajuda"
teaser: "​​This comic is very close to my heart. Although it is not fully inspired by true events, I have used topics related to my life and my personal experiences to create some of the events that Katia, the heroine or main character of this story, is dealing with and the decisions she is making. I wanted to create a different graphic style in each page of my comic, and I wanted to use this variety of styles to express emotions, the passing of time, and different shades that cannot be captured in other media. This story has no clear ending, leaving the reader looking for a plot that gives Katia a final solution or one in which she finds some happiness that lasts even after the end of the comic. I wanted to portray in this comic that life does not have a clear ending, and that sometimes problems don't go away until some time passes by and many other events take place."
