The short film touches on the topic of predestination and the existence of evil in the world, asking whether God allows evil to happen or whether it is outside of his control. The most important aspect of this film when making it was making sure not to make the Pastor's side "evil" or "incorrect," but to portray a character who is set in his beliefs and suffers as a result.
