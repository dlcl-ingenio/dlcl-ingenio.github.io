*Translated from "El poeta dice la verdad" of "Sonetos del amor oscuro" by Federico García Lorca*

<div class="stanza">
I need to cry my shame; I tell that to you<br />
so you might love me, might cry for me<br />
on an evening of nightingales<br />
with a dagger, with kisses, and with you.<br />
</div><div class="stanza">
I want to kill the only witness<br />
to the assassination of my flowers<br />
and turn my moans and sweat<br />
into an endless mound of tough wheat.<br />
</div><div class="stanza">
May it never, never end—the skein<br />
of I-love-you, you-love-me, always incensed<br />
with decrepit sun and old moon.<br />
</div><div class="stanza">
May what you don’t give and what I don’t ask<br />
of you be left for death, which doesn’t leave<br />
even a shadow on agitated flesh.<br />
</div>
