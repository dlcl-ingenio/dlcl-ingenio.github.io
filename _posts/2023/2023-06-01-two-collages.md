title:  "Two Collages"
teaser: "​​The first collage juxtaposes glittering shards of ice pushed into peaks against each other by wind and waves from the frozen surface of Lake Michigan, and the shards of terracotta ceramic vessels in a pile of broken discards saved for mosaic or landfill, highlighting the opposed and shared temporalities between these two materials. The second collage brings together thunderstorm clouds and the reflection of blue sky in a creek, blending two contrasting elements of a summer weather cycle I experienced growing up outside of Chicago to stretch out one breezy afternoon moment."
