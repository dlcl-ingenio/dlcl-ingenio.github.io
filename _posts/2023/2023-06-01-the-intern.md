title:  "The Intern"
teaser: "​​My comic deals with diversity issues in the tech industry. As a Latina woman, I'm a minority in this industry in terms of race and gender. Even though there have been some improvements in recent years, I still feel a little isolated in my classes and my summer internships. Just to give you a statistic that I learned in a class on minorities in Silicon Valley, Latin women constitute less than 2% of the total population of the tech industry. Although many people know about the diversity problem, it can still be very difficult for someone to see this beyond an unfortunate statistic and to understand what it feels to belong to a minority. It wasn't until I had the experience last summer of being the only Latina at an Amazon office that I understood how important it is to have adequate representation. I hope that portraying my real story as a comic will help other people to understand my experience and that of other minorities in technology and other industries."
