title:  "El fantasma de Brad"
teaser: "Healthism is the belief that one's health is one's own responsibility. Living a healthy life is important for everyone and it is true that one's behavior contributes to health but there are many more factors that influence health. To improve the health of the United States, these problems must be addressed. Much of medicine, however, continues to focus on individual behavior rather than the whole picture. I wanted to express my concerns about healthism in comic form because I recognize that using different mediums to convey messages can be a powerful way to reach a broader audience, and comics can be particularly effective in engaging people who might not otherwise would interact with these important topics."
