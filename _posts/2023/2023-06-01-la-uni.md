title:  "La uni"
teaser: "Eric Benitez is a 4th-year undergraduate at Stanford University majoring in Political Science. The son of two Mexican immigrants, Eric was raised in California and holds his Hispanic heritage near to his academic and creative endeavors. At Stanford, Eric has dedicated most of his time to studying American politics, the rise of political polarization, and the public’s relationship with political institutions more broadly. In writing 'La Uni,' Eric wanted to focus on the tense relationship between college students and their political expression in order to juxtapose the freedom of speech on a university campus with the harshness of modern political discourse. It is his hope that through easy-to-consume mediums like comics, political aggression, and intolerance in today’s society can be better understood, combatted, and reduced."
