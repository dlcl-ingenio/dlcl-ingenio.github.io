title:  "Un camaleón en el panteón"
teaser: "​​I grew up in Sonora, México, a small, but warm town in the middle of the desert. I decided to use the Sonoran Chamaleon as the driver of my comic because it is endemic to the region, an animal that I used to play with growing up. The cemetery is the comic’s setting because of death's beauty in my country’s culture, but also because of the prominence of unjust death in US-Mexican border communities. Murders at the hands of organized crime and femicides are too common, and I wanted my comic to make readers reflect on these injustices while finding comfort in Alicia and Felipe’s friendship in the afterlife, as my culture so beautifully does."
